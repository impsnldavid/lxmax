Lighting and DMX control extensions package for Cycling 74's Max.

## Why LXMax
The goal of LXMax is to go beyond simple DMX protocol support/hardware communication (which there are numerous externals already available for) and instead provide full first-class support for the DMX protocol and lighting control as a concept in the Max environment. You don't have to understand how a MIDI note on message is formatted in order to send one in Max, you use the noteout object. Similarily LXMax frees you from having to understand much about DMX or build a mechanism in your patcher to aggregate data into a long list of values. Instead you can simply create objects which represent each DMX fixture.

## Features
* Application-wide DMX service. LXMax maintains a constantly present DMX IO service which all active patchers can access via LXMax objects.
* Fixture objects. Rather than build a complex system to assemble and aggregate a DMX universe from various data sources, simply create an lx.dimmer or lx.colorfixture object and control it's attributes. 
* Abstracted fixture control. Control dimmers, LED and intelligent lights using values that make sense rather than raw DMX 8-bit values.
* Decoupled DMX IO. Setup DMX universes assignments and protocol configuration independently of your patch through an application wide setup window, in the same way that you would assign MIDI/audio IO.
* Flexible protocol usage. Assign and swap protocols and DMX hardware without making changes to your patch.
* Multiple patcher merging. If you have multiple patchers open trying to send data to the same fixtures, LXMax will intelligently merge them to a single output data stream.

## Build Requirements
* Visual Studio 2019 (Windows)
* XCode 9 or later (Mac OS)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.0 or later
* [Conan](https://conan.io/)

## Dependencies
* Cycling 74's min-api, part of [min-devkit](https://github.com/Cycling74/min-devkit) for Max (via submodule)
* [Poco 1.10.1](https://pocoproject.org/) (via Conan)
* dict.edit external object (included in repo, thanks to [Timothy Place](https://github.com/tap))

## Build Instructions
1. Clone to your Max packages directory (~/Documents/Max 8/Packages).
2. Run either 'SetupVSBuild.bat' for Windows or 'SetupXCodeBuild.command' for Mac. This will create a 'build' subfolder, download and build the Conan dependencies and use CMake to build the IDE projects.
3. Open the 'build' folder, open lxmax.sln or lxmax.xcodeproj and build using the IDE.
